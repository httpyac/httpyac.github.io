# Meta Data

All lines starting with `#` are interpreted as meta data lines. Lines in Format `# @foo bar` are interpreted as meta data (or alternatively `// @foo` because of [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/exploring-http-syntax.html#enable-disable-redirects)). It is possible to attach meta data that influences the processing of the request

## Name

<<< ./examples/metaData/name.http{1}

::: warning

## Ref and ForceRef

Requests can reference other requests. When the request is called, it is ensured that the referenced Request is called beforehand. `forceRef` always call the other request. `ref` only calls if no response is cached.

<<< ./examples/metaData/ref.http{1,5,10}

::: tip
